        <h1>Tapenade (Olive Spread)</h1>
        <p>This is a really simple dish to prepare and itâ€™s always a big hit at parties. My father recommends:</p>
        <p>"Make this the night before so that the flavors have time to blend. Just <br>bring it up to room temperature before you serve it. In the winter, try <br>serving it warm."</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>8oz. jar sundried tomatoes</li>
            <li>large garlic cloves</li>
            <li>2/3 c. kalamata olives</li>
            <li>1 t. capers</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine tomatoes and garlic in a food processor. Blend until as smooth <br>as possible.</li>
        <li>Add capers and olives. Pulse the motor a few times until they are <br>incorporated, but still retain some texture.</li>
        <li>Serve on thin toast rounds with goat cheese and fresh basil garnish <br>(optional).</li>
        </ol>
